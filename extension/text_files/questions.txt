Maybe have funny names for the difficulty like VERY EASY = Baby Level
                                               VERY HARD = Tony Level
																							             OOOH BABY!

Easier Questions = Less bonuses perhaps?
Maybe random number generation -> have to see how we will check the emulator results.

Question 1 (VERY EASY):

	 Create a program to move the number 10 into register 3.

Question 2 (Easy):

   Create a program which multiplies the numbers 3 and 7 together
	 and stores the result in register 9.

Question 3 (Easy):

   Create a progam which finds the bitwise OR, AND and XOR between two numbers
	 and stores them in register 8, 9, 10 respectively. Use your program on the
	 numbers 1298 and 5121.

Question 4 (Medium):

		Create a program which does the following to two numbers A and B:

			 1) A > B then store the result of A & B in register 8.
			 2) B > A then store the result of A | B in register 9.
			 3) A = B then store the result of 5 * A in register 10.

		Use the numbers A = 1000 and B = 2555

Question 5 (Medium):

	 Create a mask function which masks a number to only retain its bottom
	 3 'nibbles'. Use your program to store the masked result of 3421 in register 7
	 and the masked result of 172050 in register 4.

Question 6 (Hard):

   Create a recursive program to calculate the factorial of a number. Use your
	 program to store 11! in register 11.
