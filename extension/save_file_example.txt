This is the format the save file will have (it's a binary file, so no newlines):

<state struct>
<player_t struct>
<char *username>
for each item in player's inventory:
  <Item enum>
  <int item's hash>
<RoomName enum>
<RoomPosition enum>
for each room in the game:
  <int ItemCount>
  for each item in the room:
    <Item enum>
    <int item's hash>
